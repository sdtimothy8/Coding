The simple guide for launching ksmp project.

There are two ways for launching ksmp project, with or without apache web server, 
shown as below:
1, To launch the ksmp project with Django framework. (Without apache web server)
  python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

2, To launch the ksmp project with apache (httpd) web server.
The python module as mod_wsgi should be installed at first.
  
To use the mod_wsgi express version with Django, after having installed 
the mod_wsgi package into your Python installation, edit your Django settings module 
and add mod_wsgi.server to the list of installed apps.

INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'mod_wsgi.server',
)

If wanting to have Apache started as root in order to listen on port 8000, 
use the --setup-only option to therunmodwsgi management command.
####--Command line for creatidng shell script (as apachectl)------------------
sudo python manage.py runmodwsgi --setup-only --port=8000 \
    --user ksmp --group ksmp \
    --server-root=/etc/mod_wsgi-express-8000
    
#===============================================
The directories and files created as below:
[root@localhost mod_wsgi-express-8000]# pwd
	/etc/mod_wsgi-express-8000
[root@localhost mod_wsgi-express-8000]# ls
	apachectl     error_log     httpd.conf   resource.wsgi
	default.wsgi  handler.wsgi  httpd.pid    wsgi.10763.0.1.sock
	envvars       htdocs        python-eggs

Having created the configuration and startup script, to start the 
Apache instance you can now run:
	/etc/mod_wsgi-express-8000/apachectl start
	
To subsequently stop the Apache instance you can run:
	/etc/mod_wsgi-express-8000/apachectl stop
	
You can also restart the Apache instance as necessary using:
	/etc/mod_wsgi-express-8000/apachectl restart
